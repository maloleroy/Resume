# Hello there 👋

You are on my resume's source code repository. It's based on a common Overleaf template, heavily modified and reorganized. Feel free to use it as a template! I don't plan to write a `.cls` file for it, at least for now.

To check out my resume, [visit this link](https://github.com/maloleroy/Resume/raw/refs/heads/main/CV_Malo_Leroy.pdf) or just clone the repo and compile the LaTeX! It's `pdflatex` and XeTeX-compatible. I'm open to any improvement suggestions or questions about the contents, the phrasing or the LaTeX, so feel free to open an issue!
